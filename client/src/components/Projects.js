        I've worked on a variety of projects during my time at Flatiron, some of
        which include areas of personal interest.

        I had the idea to have a place to store family recipes and share them
        with the world. I was helping family clean out old items and I came
        across a recipe book. It was written with a pencil and the lead was
        fading. I thought to myself that a family passdown like this should be
        preserved.
