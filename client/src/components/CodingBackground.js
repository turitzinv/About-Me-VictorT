      <h3>What began my interests</h3>
      <p className="background-p">
        My coding journey began out of pure curiousity. With extra time on my
        hands working from home during the Covid shutdown. I began watching many
        YouTube tutorials and following along in Xcode using Swift.

        It didn't take long for me to sign up at FreeCodeCamp and I began to
        learn JavaScript tutorials. A life event really made me contemplate my
        future and the career path I was following. I currently work in the
        Advertising/Sales industry but I was curious about changing careers. Can
        it be done? How often have people done it?
      </p>
      <p className="background-p">
        In my research, I came across coding bootcamps. I was very much hesitant
        about the idea of school, especially while holding down a full time job.
        Although hesistant, the idea of it was a planted seed that began to
        grow. I was curious of others who have gone through bootcamps. I began
        researching bootcamps and listening to YouTube reviews where alumni from
        various bootcamps were interviewed about their experiences.
